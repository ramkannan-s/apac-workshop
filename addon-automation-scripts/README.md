# APAC Workshop 2023 - Lab Setup Guide

JFrog SaaS Environments. 

A set of SaaS Environment as per requirement will be created and shared. 


## Prerequisites

- Login to SaaS with default credentials and create a user as `svc_jfrog_user` and with any random password. 
- Install the [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) in the VM / Box where the scripts are going to be triggered. 
- Add the following server :- 
  - Server used by participants - eg: `jf_lab_server`
``` 
jf c add jf_lab_server --url "https://<server_id>.jfrog.io/" --user="svc_jfrog_user" --access-token="****"

jf c use jf_lab_server
```
Access Token to be generated by the JFrog Engineer who is going to setup the Lab. 

**Note**: JF CLI should by default use only the `jf_lab_server`.


## Scripts to Trigger

> **Navigate to `users-groups-projects` folder**. 

> Perform `chmod +x *` inside the folder.

#### Create Users 

* Trigger the script :-
```bash
./createUsers.sh jf_lab_server
```

* The above script will first set auto-join for `readers group` to `false` and then reads data from `workshop-users-list.csv` file and create as many users as present in the CSV file. 

* Validate the users are present the JFrog Server.

  * `projectidprefix`
  * `userprefix`

* Trigger the script :-
```bash
./createProjectsUsers.sh https://<server_name>.jfrog.io ****
```

* The above script will create projects with respect to the given `projectCount` value in the script and map the respective users of each count to the project created.
eg: `project-1` takes `user-1` as Project Admin

> **Note**: The project count and user count present in CSV should be equal. ie `projectcount == usercount`.

./multi-repo-create.sh
```

jf c add proservices --url "https://proservices.jfrog.io/" --user="svc_jfrog_user"
```
The access token will be shared at the time of lab setup


* Edit the following values in the script (`multi-repo-create.sh`) with respect to the event to be carried out :
  * `repo_name_prefix`
  * `repo_name_suffix`

(**NOTE :** The above values should be the same as values added in #### Create Repositories in Artifactory section.)

#### Script to Trigger during the event

* Participants may require temporary `admin` access to the artifactory for testing some scenarios like Federated Repositories, Access Federation, etc.

* Navigate to `users-groups-projects` folder.

* Trigger the script to **Grant admin access** :
